# Screen Dimmer

## Important Note About Digital Signatures
⚠️ This application is not digitally signed. When installing, you may receive warnings from your operating system:

- **Windows**: You may see a "Windows protected your PC" message. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed.
- **macOS**: You'll need to right-click (or Control-click) the app and select "Open" the first time. Select "Open" when prompted.
- **Linux**: No special steps needed, but you may need to mark the AppImage as executable.

I'm an independent developer and haven't purchased code signing certificates. The application is open source and you can inspect/build the code yourself if you have security concerns.

Here is a simple controller - change your color, select displays, enable/disable and of course control the intensity:
